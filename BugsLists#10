Project: Make a quiz 

Bug hunt #1
There are a lot of common bugs that can happen when we're working with lists, and it can be a bit like searching for a needle in a haystack!

This lesson will help you to become familiar with the most common bugs, while building a basic quiz type program.

Let's get hunting! First up - creating lists.

#Questions and answers for a quiz
questions = ["How many bits are in a byte?,
            "True or False? A nibble is half a byte.",
            'What year was Google founded?",
            "How many zeroes are in a Googol?"
            "How many bytes are in a kilobyte?"

answers = ["8", "true", "1998"; "100", "1024]

#Ask the user their name and welcome them to the quiz

# Bug hunt, This bug hunt will help you find common bugs when adding and deleting values from lists. Mix append with insert or pop with remove methods.

# Read the first comment in the code editor to find out what the program does. Let's go! 

# Final Draft
#This code shows the user a list of classic games and asks them to choose their favorite. This value gets moved to the top of the list, and then the user can add another game to the list.

#Create a list of some of the top classic games
top_games = ["pacman", "tetris", "space invaders", "sonic the hedgehog", "super mario brothers", "street fighter", "pong", "donkey kong", "paperboy"]

#Print list of games

Bug Hunt - looping, shuffling and sorting.
Let's look for some common bugs when looping through lists, shuffling them and sorting them.
