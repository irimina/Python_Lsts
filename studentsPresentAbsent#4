'''
Finding the length of a list using len()
We can use the function len() on a string and it will tell us how many characters, including spaces, are in the string:

a_string = "hovercraft"
print(len(a_string)) #Prints 10
When used on a list, it tells us how many items are in the list:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "coconut"]
print(len(fruits)) #Prints 3

print("There are ", len(students_present), "and", len(students_absent))

student = input("Enter a name to find out if the student is present or absent: ")

if student in students_present:
  print(student.capitalize(), " is present today.")
elif student in students_absent:
  print(student.title(), " is absent today.")
else:
  print("Sorry, no student called ", student.title(), "exists!")
