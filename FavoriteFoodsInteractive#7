'''
Count how many times a value is in a list
We know how to find the length of an entire list, but it is also useful to be able to find out how many times a value is in a list. 
This is useful for several reasons:

To find out if a value is already in a list e.g. before adding it again.
To find out if a value is in there more than once e.g. to remove duplicates
To simply find out how many of that value are in the list.

#Start a loop to ask user to enter their favorite foods
repeat = True
while repeat==True:
  food = input("Please enter a favorite food or 'done' to end input: ")
  #Check if user has entered done so that loop can be stopped if so
  if food == 'done':
    repeat = False
  else:
    count = favorite_foods.count(food)
    #Check if food is already in list
    #If so, give user error message, otherwise add the food and give success message
    if count > 0:
      print("Sorry", food, "is already on the list!")
    else:
      favorite_foods.append(food)
      print(food, "has been added!")

#Once user is done, print out their list for them
print("Your favorite foods are: ")

for food in favorite_foods:
  print(food.title()) #Add a capital letter
