MODIFY a value in a list. INSERT a value in a list. REMOVE a value from a list 
To change a value in a list, we simply use its index and set it equal to a new value like a regular variable:

winners = ["shirley", "brian", "tom"]
 #Actually Ryan came second
winners[1] = "ryan"

'''

# Top 5 video games this week
top_games = ["Battlefield: Hardline", "Final Fantasy: Type-0", "Mario Party 10", "Resident Evil: Revelations 2", "Grand Theft Auto V"]
print(top_games)

# Change 5th place with the new game and drop the Grand Theft
top_games[4]="Assassin's Creed: Unity"
print(top_games)

Adding a new value to the end of a list using append()
To add a new value to the end of a list, we use a function called append():

items = ["pen", "paper", "chalk"]
#add blackboard to the end 
items.append("blackboard")

'''
#Current Knights of Ni!, This is a list of the current members of one chapter of the Knights who say Ni! Print 
order_knights = ["Stevyn the Kind", "Selle the Swift","Nigs the Fierce", "Jacomynus the Honorable", "Janyn the Warrior", "Mauger the Dragon", "Viliame the Stubborn", "Dreues the Unbreakable"]
print(order_knights)

#Add the new member and print list
order_knights.append("Raymond the Brute")
print(order_knights)

#List of weapons available
weapons_available = ["Dagger", "Lance", "Flail", "Medieval Sword", "Broadsword", "Falchion sword", "Greatsword", "Longsword"]
print(weapons_available)

#Add 'mace' to the list and print
weapons_available.append("mace")
print(weapons_available)

############################################################################
# insert an item at a particpualr position 
'''
n the list, rather than just at the end. To do this, we use the insert() function:

weekdays = ["Mon", "Tue", "Thu", "Fri"]
#Add Wed in 3rd position (starts at 0)
weekdays.insert(2, "Wed")
'''
#Incomplete list of Months of the year. Add the rest of the months
months = ["Jan", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Nov"]

#insert the missing months at the correct possitions, do one at a time
#Add in the missing months in order (3 letter abbreviations)
months.insert(1, "Feb")
months.insert(5, "June")
months.insert(9, "Oct")
months.append("Dec")

print(len(months)). #

#Current Knights of Ni!
'''
Just like adding values, there are 2 ways to remove values from a list:

my_list = ["pen", "pencil", "eraser"]
#Pop removes from a position using the index 
my_list.pop(1) #Removes 'pencil' 
#Remove() uses the value itself, removes 1st 
  # matching value
my_list.remove("eraser")#removes 'eraser'

'''

#List of weapons available
weapons_available = ["Dagger", "Lance", "Flail", "Medieval Sword", "Broadsword", "Falchion sword", "Greatsword", "Longsword"]
print(weapons_available)

#Remove dagger and print list


#Current Knights of Ni!
order_knights = ["Stevyn the Kind", "Selle the Swift","Nigs the Fierce", "Jacomynus the Honorable", "Janyn the Warrior", "Mauger the Dragon", "Viliame the Stubborn", "Dreues the Unbreakable"]
print(order_knights)

#Remove Selle the Swift
order_knights.pop(1)
print(order_knights)

#List of weapons available
weapons_available = ["Dagger", "Lance", "Flail", "Medieval Sword", "Broadsword", "Falchion sword", "Greatsword", "Longsword"]
print(weapons_available)

#Remove dagger and print list
weapons_available.remove("Dagger")
print(weapons_available)
